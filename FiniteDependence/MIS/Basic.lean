Basic algebraic lemmas used by the finite-certificates.

We keep the Lean development focused on the *algebraic contradictions* that appear in
`PROOF_k_le_5.md`. Formalizing the full probability-theoretic setup (stationary
k-dependent processes on `ℤ`) is possible but substantially larger; the goal here is
to make the key polynomial identities and contradictions fully machine-checkable.
